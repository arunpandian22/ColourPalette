# ColourPalette
* Good visual design is essential for a successful app, and color schemes are a primary component of design. The palette library is a support library that extracts prominent colors from images to help you create visually engaging apps.

* You can use the palette library to design layout themes and apply custom colors to visual elements in your app. For example, you can use a palette to create a color-coordinated title card for a song based on its album cover or to adjust an appâ€™s toolbar color when its background image changes. The Palette object gives you access to the colors in a Bitmap image while also providing six main color profiles from the bitmap to help inform your design choices.
